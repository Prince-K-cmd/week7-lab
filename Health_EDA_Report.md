# Health EDA Report

This report summarizes the key findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the heart health dataset, as requested in the `Health_EDA.pdf` document.

## Data Cleaning

The dataset was loaded and inspected for any issues. The following cleaning steps were performed:

- **Misrepresented Data:** The data types and unique values of each column were checked using the `analyze_column_types` function. This ensured data quality and identified potential issues early on. No misrepresented data was found. Numerical features like 'age', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'thalach', and 'oldpeak' showed expected ranges and distributions. Categorical features like 'sex', 'cp', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'exang', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal', and 'heart_disease' had appropriate categories.
- **Missing Values:** The number of missing values in each column was checked using `df.isnull().sum()`. No missing values were found, so no imputation was needed.
- **Duplicates:** The `handle_duplicates` function checked for and removed duplicate rows. No duplicate rows were found in the dataset.

## Univariate Analysis

The distributions of numerical and categorical variables were analyzed:

- **Numerical Variables:** The `plot_distributions` function generated histograms and boxplots to visualize the distributions of numerical variables like 'age', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'thalach', and 'oldpeak'. The distributions provided insights into the range, central tendency, and spread of each variable, helping to identify potential outliers and understand the overall data distribution.
- **Categorical Variables:** The `plot_categorical_distributions` function created bar charts to analyze the distributions of categorical variables like 'sex', 'cp', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'exang', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal', and 'heart_disease'. These charts showed the frequency and percentage of each category within each variable, providing insights into the prevalence of different categories.

## Bivariate Analysis

Relationships between variables were explored:

- **Numerical-Numerical Relationships:** The `plot_scatterplots` function generated scatterplots to visualize relationships between pairs of numerical variables. Additionally, the `plot_correlation_matrix` function calculated and visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap. This helped identify potential linear relationships between numerical features.
- **Categorical-Numerical Relationships:** The `plot_boxplots` function created boxplots to compare the distribution of numerical variables across different categories of categorical variables. These boxplots helped visualize potential differences in numerical features based on categorical features, providing insights into how different categories might influence numerical distributions.
- **Categorical-Categorical Relationships:** Crosstabs (contingency tables) and heatmaps were generated to explore relationships between pairs of categorical variables. These visualizations showed the frequency of co-occurrence between different categories, helping to understand potential associations between categorical features.

## Multivariate Analysis

The `sns.pairplot(df)` function generated pair plots to visualize multiple relationships between variables simultaneously. This provided a comprehensive overview of potential interactions and correlations between multiple features in the dataset.

## Deliverables

This section addresses the questions under "Deliverables" number 2 in the `Health_EDA.pdf`:

1. **What are the most significant predictors of heart disease?**

   Based on the correlation matrix generated by the code, `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) shows a moderate negative correlation with heart disease, suggesting that lower maximum heart rates might be associated with a higher risk of heart disease. `exang` (exercise-induced angina) also appears as a potential predictor, as the boxplots comparing its distribution against heart disease diagnosis show some differences. Other variables like 'cp' (chest pain type) also show potential predictive value in the boxplots against 'heart_disease'. Further statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing, would be needed to confirm the significance of these predictors.

2. **Are there notable patterns (e.g., higher risk in certain age groups or genders)?**

   The visualizations reveal several notable patterns:

   - Boxplots of numerical features against 'cp' (chest pain type) show varying distributions. For example, 'thalach' tends to be lower and 'oldpeak' tends to be higher in certain chest pain types, suggesting a potential link between chest pain characteristics and heart rate/ST depression.
   - The crosstabs and heatmaps of categorical variables reveal potential associations. For example, the relationship between 'sex' (gender) and 'heart_disease' can be observed, although further analysis is needed to determine if this difference is statistically significant. Similarly, the relationship between 'thal' and 'heart_disease' can be further explored.
   - The pairplots provide a visual overview of potential interactions between multiple features, allowing for the identification of complex relationships and patterns. For example, the scatterplots within the pairplot can reveal clusters or trends that might not be apparent in individual bivariate plots.

   Further investigation and statistical testing are recommended to confirm the significance of these patterns and explore potential causal relationships.
